Based on the world of *Cyberpunk 2077*, **Edgerunners** by *Studio Trigger* is a vibrant, gritty series that thrusts viewers into the harsh realities of **Night City**. This anime-style series perfectly captures the cyberpunk aesthetic, mixing high-octane action with heart-wrenching drama.

### Key Elements

1. **Intense Visual Style**
   - Character designs and neon-lit backdrops bring out the *cyberpunk* aesthetic.
   - The animation style is exaggerated yet visceral, making each fight scene unforgettable.

2. **Themes of Cybernetic Overload**
   - Explores the idea of humanity versus machine, with **cyberpsychosis** as a central threat.
   - Characters struggle with losing their identity in the face of advanced tech enhancements.

3. **Memorable Soundtrack**
   - With tracks like *“I Really Want to Stay at Your House”* by Rosa Walton, the soundtrack is as emotionally charged as the story.
